Gesture Controlled Car is a robot which can be controlled by simple human hand gesture. My objective is to make this device simple as well as cheap so it can be produced and used for number of purposes like remote surveillance, military, physically challenged in wheelchairs, eliminate a lot of manual labour in construction field or industries to control trolly and lift etc. 
In this project user is able to control motions of the car by wearing controller glove and performing predefined gestures.
